# What is LaunchDarkly?

LaunchDarkly serves a suite of tools that help you ship your code safer, faster, and more effectively with whatever language and frameworks you use today.

# How can LaunchDarkly help you?

- _Feature flags_ let you reduce the risk of releasing new features by rolling them out progressively across subsets of your users over time.
- _Guarded releases_ monitor the performance of flag releases and configure LaunchDarkly to take action on the results.
- _AI Configs_ help you customize, test, and roll out new large language models (LLMs) within your generative AI applications.
- _Experimentation_ lets you validate the impact of features you roll out to your app or infrastructure. You can measure things like page views, clicks, load time, infrastructure costs, and more.
